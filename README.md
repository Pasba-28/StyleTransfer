# StyleTransfer

This project was made for HIT college.

Got help with this tutorial:

https://www.maurocomi.com/transfer-style.html -> 

using the class "Evaluator" + functions.





# User instructions:

## 1) chose a content image from menu (options are between1-3).
For example:
![content3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69638284/104102951-33161280-52a8-11eb-8e02-92a1e566aebe.png)

## 2) chose a style image from menu (options are between 1-6).
For example:
![style5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69638284/104102961-36a99980-52a8-11eb-9796-2e491f830c08.jpg)

3) Fature visualization by blocks:
  1.  ['block1_conv1', 'block1_conv2']
  2.  ['block2_conv1', 'block2_conv2']
  3.  ['block3_conv1', 'block3_conv4']
  4.  ['block4_conv1', 'block4_conv4']
  5.  ['block5_conv1']
  
    All combined:
      ['block1_conv1', 'block1_conv2',
      'block2_conv1', 'block2_conv2',
      'block3_conv1', 'block3_conv4',
      'block4_conv1', 'block4_conv4',
      'block5_conv1']


3) Now the image is processing by the new style.

4) Saving video to show full transition.
